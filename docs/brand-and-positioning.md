# Arcata: Brand & Positioning

## Core Belief

> **Getting hired is driven more by probability and luck than by raw skill or experience.**

The job market is not a meritocracy. It is a numbers game. The best candidate does not always win. The candidate who puts themselves in the best position does. Arcata exists to help candidates improve the odds.

**TLDR: Probability beats skills and experience**

## Mission

> We believe the right opportunities should find you, and our technology makes that possible.

## The Problem

### 1. Big Tech Owns the Hiring Surface Area

Large companies dominate job boards and recruiting platforms because they can afford to. They crowd out smaller companies. The result:

* Thousands of applicants per role
* The math is stacked against you
* High-quality roles at smaller companies stay hidden

### 2. The Process Is Brutal

Job hunting is time-consuming and draining:

* Searching and filtering jobs manually
* Rewriting resumes and cover letters for every role
* Losing track of applications and timelines
* Rejection with no feedback and no signal

### 3. Your Experience Is Hard to Use When It Matters

Most candidates cannot quickly recall or articulate past wins. Experience lives in scattered notes and half-remembered stories. When asked “tell me about a time when,” the signal gets lost.

## Two Strategies: Long Poll vs Fast Track

Not all opportunities are equal. There are two distinct paths.

### Long Poll (Big Tech, FAANG)

* Slow, rigid interview processes
* Heavy presence on job boards
* Massive applicant pools
* Requires patience and persistence
* Odds are not great for most people

### Fast Track (Startups)

* Hiring needs are immediate
* Interview processes are inconsistent but fast
* Limited recruiting budgets and teams
* Fewer applicants per role
* Faster decisions and more luck involved

Arcata does not force a strategy. Candidates choose. We help them execute. The real issue is visibility. Most candidates only see Long Poll roles because Big Tech dominates distribution. Arcata surfaces Fast Track roles that never hit the mainstream.

### Rejection Is Expected

Rejection is normal. When a user marks a role as rejected:

* Normalize it with real statistics
* Reinforce that rejection is progress
* Emphasize that this is not personal

### Help Users Get Better

Job hunting is a skill:

* Surface patterns across applications
* Highlight what is working and what is not
* Encourage iteration, not blind repetition

### Users Know More Than We Do

Candidates find roles we miss:

* Allow manual job imports
* Let users flag unrecognized fields
* Improve the system by learning from usage
