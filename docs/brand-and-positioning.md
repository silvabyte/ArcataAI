# Arcata: Brand & Positioning

## Core Belief

> **Getting hired has more to do with probabilities and serendipity than your actual experience and skillset.**

The job market isn't a meritocracy—it's a numbers game. The best candidate doesn't always win; the candidate who stacks the odds in their favor does. Arcata exists to help candidates play the probability game smarter.

**The TLDR: Probability > Skills and Experience**

## Mission Statement

> We believe in a job market where the right opportunities find you, and our technology makes this a reality.

## The Problem We Solve

### 1. Big Tech Dominates Hiring Channels

Large companies dominate job boards and recruiting platforms due to massive budgets. They're everywhere you look, drowning out smaller opportunities. This means:

- You're competing against thousands of applicants for every posting
- The math (statistically) isn't in your favor
- Hidden opportunities at great companies rarely surface

### 2. The Process is Tedious and Demoralizing

Job hunting is exhausting:

- Manually searching, filtering, and tracking applications
- Writing custom cover letters for each role
- Losing track of where you applied and what stage you're at
- Getting rejected repeatedly with no feedback loop

### 3. Your Experience Gets Lost in Translation

Candidates struggle to recall and articulate their accomplishments during interviews. Years of experience sit in scattered notes, impossible to quickly reference when a hiring manager asks "tell me about a time when..."

## Two Strategies: Fast Track vs Long Poll

Not all job opportunities are created equal. We recognize two distinct strategies for approaching the job market:

### Long Poll (Big Tech / FAANG)

- Lengthy, systematized interview processes
- Dominate recruiting channels due to large budgets
- Result in significantly more applicants per role
- Requires patience and persistence—the math isn't in most folks' favor

### Fast Track (Startups)

- Need talent *yesterday*
- Interview processes are ad-hoc and vary by company
- Can't compete with Big Tech for candidate pipeline—they lack both budget and recruiting team
- Less competition, faster decisions, more serendipity

**Arcata doesn't prescribe one strategy over the other.** Candidates choose their focus—we help them execute whichever approach they pursue. The key insight is that most candidates only see Long Poll opportunities because Big Tech dominates hiring channels. We surface the Fast Track opportunities that would otherwise stay hidden.

## Experience Principles

### Rejection is Part of the Game

Getting rejected stings. When a user marks an application as rejected, acknowledge the moment:

- Surface encouraging statistics that normalize rejection
- *"Don't sweat it—this is one 'no' closer to the 'yes'."*
- Reinforce that job hunting is a numbers game, not a referendum on their worth

### Help Candidates Grow

The job hunt is a skill. Help users get better at it:

- Surface patterns from their applications (which roles get responses, which don't)
- Integrate feedback to refine future applications
- Guide iteration rather than just tracking status

### Users Know Things We Don't

Candidates discover opportunities we haven't indexed. Respect that knowledge:

- Let users import job listings they've found
- Allow them to flag application fields Arcata doesn't recognize
- Build a system that learns from users and gets smarter over time
