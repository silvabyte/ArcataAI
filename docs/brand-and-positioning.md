# Arcata: Brand & Positioning

## Core Belief

> **Getting hired has more to do with probabilities and serendipity than your actual experience and skillset.**

The job market isn't a meritocracy—it's a numbers game. The best candidate doesn't always win; the candidate who stacks the odds in their favor does. Arcata exists to help candidates play the probability game smarter.

**The TLDR: Probability > Skills and Experience**

## Mission Statement

> We believe in a job market where the right opportunities find you, and our technology makes this a reality.

## The Problem We Solve

### 1. Big Tech Dominates Hiring Channels

Large companies dominate job boards and recruiting platforms due to massive budgets. They're everywhere you look, drowning out smaller opportunities. This means:

- You're competing against thousands of applicants for every posting
- The math (statistically) isn't in your favor
- Hidden opportunities at great companies rarely surface

### 2. The Process is Tedious and Demoralizing

Job hunting is exhausting:

- Manually searching, filtering, and tracking applications
- Writing custom cover letters for each role
- Losing track of where you applied and what stage you're at
- Getting rejected repeatedly with no feedback loop

### 3. Your Experience Gets Lost in Translation

Candidates struggle to recall and articulate their accomplishments during interviews. Years of experience sit in scattered notes, impossible to quickly reference when a hiring manager asks "tell me about a time when..."

## Our Strategy: Fast Track vs Long Poll

Not all job opportunities are created equal. We categorize them into two types:

### Long Poll Opportunities (Think Big Tech)

- Lengthy, systematized interview processes
- Dominate recruiting channels due to large budgets
- Result in significantly more applicants per role
- **The math isn't looking good for most folks**

### Fast Track Opportunities (Startups)

- Need talent *yesterday*
- Interview processes are ad-hoc and vary by company
- Can't compete with Big Tech for candidate pipeline—they lack both budget and recruiting team
- **Less competition, faster decisions, more serendipity**

**Our focus:** Surface Fast Track opportunities that candidates would never find on their own. Help them compete where the odds are actually in their favor.
